Native macOS companion for Hermes Agent, directly on this Mac or over SSH.

It turns the daily Hermes loop into something you can actually live in on a
Mac: sessions, workflows, Kanban, workspace files, usage, skills, cron jobs,
and a real terminal in one focused window.

If Hermes is already part of how you work, the app should feel immediately
legible. Same host. Same files. Same profiles. Same source of truth.

No browser wrapper. No gateway API. No daemon on the host. No local mirror. No
extra sync layer slowly drifting away from the machine that actually matters.

That restraint is the point of the app.

Hermes Desktop does not invent a softer second version of Hermes. It gives the
real machine-first workflow a calm, fast, native Mac surface while keeping the model
visible. You always know which host you are on, which Hermes profile is active,
which path the app is using, and where the work is happening.

## What Hermes Desktop gives you

Hermes Desktop is for people who want a native Mac workbench for the Hermes
host they already use, without adding another layer to trust.

- connects directly to Hermes on this Mac or to another machine over SSH
- keeps the Hermes host as the only source of truth
- works with multiple Hermes profiles for a multi-agent workflow
- reads the real sessions, Kanban, cron jobs, skills, files, and usage
- saves reusable workflow presets locally on your Mac, then launches them
  against the selected connection/profile in a fresh Terminal tab
- includes an embedded local or SSH terminal for the moments where the shell is still
  the right tool
- ships as a universal macOS app for Apple Silicon and Intel Macs
- includes English, Simplified Chinese, and Russian localization resources

Use direct-local mode when Hermes is installed on this Mac. Use SSH mode for a
Raspberry Pi, another Mac, a VPS, or a remote server.

## How the app is designed

The app runs the same service commands either locally or over SSH. Sessions
come from the real session store. Kanban comes from the upstream Hermes Kanban
home. Cron jobs come from the real scheduler state. Files and skills are edited
in place with conflict checks before save.

That restraint has a practical advantage: Hermes Desktop can remain useful when
higher-level surfaces are unavailable. If a dashboard, gateway, or agent
configuration breaks, the app still has the direct machine path: inspect the
real Hermes state, edit the relevant files, open a terminal, and repair the
system from the place where the state actually lives.

### Desktop and web dashboard

Hermes also has an official web dashboard. The two tools are complementary.

Use the dashboard when you want a browser-based management surface for the
installation: configuration, API keys, logs, sessions, analytics, cron jobs,
skills, and web chat.

Use Hermes Desktop when you want to work directly with Hermes from your Mac:
sessions, workflows, Kanban, files, editable skills, usage, cron jobs, and a
real terminal without adding another backend around Hermes.

The boundary is simple: browser for administration, Mac app for direct Hermes
work.

## Before you install

Setup is intentionally lightweight. Before you install, make sure you have:

- a Mac running macOS 14 or newer
- `python3` available on the machine where Hermes runs
- Hermes data under that user's `~/.hermes`, a named profile, or a configured
  custom Hermes home

For SSH connections, you additionally need SSH access, an accepted host key,
non-interactive authentication, and a working network route.

For Sessions Chat, Terminal resume, and workflow launch, the `hermes` CLI needs
to be available through the app's prepared shell `PATH`.

For the native Kanban workspace, the host needs a Hermes Agent build with
upstream Kanban support. Newer Kanban features appear automatically when the
host exposes them.

For an SSH connection, the simple rule is: if this works in Terminal from this
Mac without asking for a password or host key confirmation, the app is usually
ready too:

```bash
ssh your-host
```

## Install the app

1. Download `HermesDesktop.app.zip` from the
   [latest GitHub Release](https://github.com/dodo-reach/hermes-desktop/releases/latest).
2. Double click the zip to extract `HermesDesktop.app`.
3. Quit Hermes Desktop if an older version is already running.
4. Drag `HermesDesktop.app` into `Applications` and replace the old copy if
   macOS asks.
5. First launch: right click `HermesDesktop.app`, choose `Open`, then confirm
   `Open`. This remains the normal first-launch path on supported macOS
   versions.

Hermes Desktop is currently ad-hoc signed and not notarized by Apple. macOS may
show a first-launch warning saying Apple cannot verify it for malware. That is
expected for this distribution model and does not mean macOS found malware in
Hermes Desktop.

If macOS shows the usual unidentified-developer warning:

1. Click `Done`, not `Move to Bin`.
2. Right click `HermesDesktop.app` and choose `Open`.
3. If needed, go to `System Settings` > `Privacy & Security` and click
   `Open Anyway`.

### macOS 26.5.1 shows that the app is damaged

On some Macs running macOS 26.5.1 (build 25F80), Gatekeeper may instead say
that Hermes Desktop "is damaged and can't be opened" and may not offer
`Open Anyway`. The additional steps below are only for that macOS version and
build when that exact alert appears.

First, verify that the zip came from the official GitHub Release. Run:

```bash
shasum -a 256 ~/Downloads/HermesDesktop.app.zip
```

Compare the result with `HermesDesktop.app.zip.sha256` attached to the same
release. Do not continue if the values differ. After extracting the verified
zip and moving `HermesDesktop.app` to Applications, remove the browser
quarantine from this app only, then open it:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/HermesDesktop.app"
open "/Applications/HermesDesktop.app"
```

These commands do not disable Gatekeeper globally and do not require `sudo`.
They remove the download quarantine only from the verified Hermes Desktop app.

### Build locally instead

The free alternative with the clearest trust path is to inspect the source and
build Hermes Desktop locally. A local build does not inherit browser download
quarantine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dodo-reach/hermes-desktop.git
cd hermes-desktop
./scripts/build-macos-app.sh
open "dist/HermesDesktop.app"
```

Do not disable Gatekeeper or run `sudo` commands to install Hermes Desktop.

For the exact distribution and verification details, read
[docs/distribution.md](docs/distribution.md). If you prefer not to trust the
release zip, build from source instead.

## Connect Hermes

Open the app, go to `Connections`, create a profile, choose `This Mac` or
`SSH Host`, then test the connection.

### Use Hermes on this Mac

Choose `This Mac`. No SSH alias, host, user, or port is required. Hermes
Desktop launches local commands with the current macOS user's permissions and
works against that account's real Hermes files, profiles, Cron jobs, Kanban
data, sessions, and CLI.

Local mode is explicit. It is never inferred from an incomplete SSH profile,
and it is distinct from an SSH profile targeting `localhost`.

### Use an SSH host

Choose `SSH Host`, then connect with an SSH alias or host details directly.

### Use an SSH alias

An SSH alias is the cleanest path for most people. It is the short name you
already use in Terminal:

```bash
ssh hermes-home
```

That name usually comes from `~/.ssh/config`:

```sshconfig
Host hermes-home
  HostName vps.example.com
  User alex
```

In the app:

- set `SSH alias` to `hermes-home`
- leave `Host`, `User`, and `Port` empty unless you want explicit overrides

### Use host details

If you normally connect with:

```bash
ssh alex@vps.example.com
```

then in the app:

- `Host or IP`: `vps.example.com`
- `User`: `alex`
- `Port`: `22` or your real SSH port

### Choose a Hermes profile

Hermes Desktop can target multiple profiles in either local or SSH mode.

- leave `Hermes profile` empty to use `~/.hermes`; the app still discovers
  other profiles available through the active connection
- set `Hermes profile` to `researcher` to use
  `~/.hermes/profiles/researcher`

The profile is not just a label. It flows through the app: Sessions, Workflows,
Cron Jobs, Kanban, Files, Usage, Skills, and Terminal all stay aligned with
the selected connection and profile.

### What `Test` checks

`Test` is a preflight. In local mode it verifies that Hermes Desktop can launch
commands and find `python3` as the current macOS user. In SSH mode it checks
reachability, non-interactive authentication, and `python3` in the remote SSH
environment.

Feature-specific requirements, such as the `hermes` CLI path and Kanban
support, are checked when those sections actually run.

## What you can do in the app

Hermes Desktop is intentionally focused. It is not trying to become a cloud
workspace, a remote IDE, or a generic SFTP client.

It gives the real Hermes workflow a native workbench:

- `Sessions`
  Searches and reads the real session store, including transcript content.
  You can pin important sessions, resume a session in the embedded TUI chat
  or in Terminal, and keep the session history close while you work.
- `Workflows`
  Saves reusable prompt presets on your Mac, scoped to the active
  connection/profile,
  with optional skill selections. Running one opens a fresh Terminal tab and
  seeds the first Hermes turn without adding any shadow state.
- `Kanban`
  Opens the upstream Hermes Kanban workspace from the active machine. Board
  management, task editing, triage flows, comments, dependencies, run history,
  and recovery actions appear when the Hermes installation supports them.
- `Files`
  Edits canonical Hermes files and selected text files with conflict checks
  before save.
- `Cron Jobs`
  Browses and manages the real Hermes scheduler state, including create, edit,
  pause, resume, run-now, and delete actions.
- `Usage`
  Shows token totals, top sessions, top models, recent trends, and profile
  breakdowns when available.
- `Skills`
  Discovers real `SKILL.md` files, reads skill metadata, and lets you create
  or edit skills anchored to the active Hermes skills store.
- `Terminal`
  Opens a real local or SSH shell inside the app, with tabs, theme presets,
  font controls, background-image transparency, and enough room for
  multi-profile, multi-agent work.

## Which chat surface to use

Hermes Desktop does not replace the terminal surfaces Hermes already gives you.
It lets you choose the right one for the job.

- Use `Chat` in `Sessions` when you want the real Hermes TUI embedded in the
  app, already scoped to the active connection and Hermes profile. The Chat
  view is a hosted `hermes --tui` session — there is no separate Desktop
  conversation layer in front of it.
- Use `Transcript` in `Sessions` when you want to inspect persisted history from
  the host without starting or resuming a live TUI.
- Use the embedded `Terminal` for heavier work where you want shell control,
  command approvals, long-running output, or manual review close at hand.
- Use `hermes --tui` in any terminal when you want the same Hermes TUI outside
  the desktop layout.

All of these paths still run Hermes on the selected machine. The choice is
about surface area, not about creating a second source of truth.

## Trust and verification

If you are evaluating whether to trust Hermes Desktop, start here:

- read [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the current security model: what runs
  directly on this Mac, what can run remotely over SSH, what the app stores,
  and which network calls it makes
- read [docs/distribution.md](docs/distribution.md) for the release model,
  including the limits of ad-hoc signing and what published checksums can and
  cannot prove
- build the app from source with `./scripts/build-macos-app.sh` if you prefer
  the clearest trust path available in this repo today

Current public releases include a SHA-256 checksum and a small JSON manifest
for `HermesDesktop.app.zip`.

After downloading:

```bash
shasum -a 256 HermesDesktop.app.zip
```

After installing:

```bash
codesign --verify --deep --strict /Applications/HermesDesktop.app
```

To verify a release zip against the published manifest from a repo checkout:

```bash
./scripts/verify-release.sh \
  /path/to/HermesDesktop.app.zip \
  /path/to/HermesDesktop.app.zip.manifest.json
```

Checksums are a useful integrity check, not a trust model. They tell you
whether your download matches the published release asset. They do not replace
source review, local builds, or understanding the current distribution model.

## Build locally

For cautious users, building from source is the clearest trust path available
in this repo today. For local development, it is also the supported path for
producing the app bundle directly:

```bash
./scripts/build-macos-app.sh
```

Then open:

```bash
dist/HermesDesktop.app
```

To run the release-support test suite:

```bash
./scripts/run-tests.sh
```

To create the GitHub Releases archive:

```bash
./scripts/package-github-release.sh
```

For release-candidate packaging, you can stamp an explicit version:

```bash
HERMES_VERSION=1.2.3 ./scripts/package-github-release.sh
```

Release artifacts:

- `dist/HermesDesktop.app.zip`
- `dist/HermesDesktop.app.zip.sha256`
- `dist/HermesDesktop.app.zip.manifest.json`

## FAQ

### Is it safe to install?

That is the right question, and you should not rely on reassurance alone.

Hermes Desktop is open source, runs directly against Hermes on this Mac or over
SSH to the host you choose, does not require a gateway API or helper service,
and stores only a small amount of app state on your Mac. The built-in update
check calls GitHub Releases for the latest Hermes Desktop app version only; it
does not update Hermes Agent and does not send your connection, profile, file,
session, or Kanban content.

The current public build is ad-hoc signed and not notarized by Apple, so
macOS may show a first-launch warning. On some Macs running macOS 26.5.1
(build 25F80), Gatekeeper may show a stronger "damaged" alert; follow the
version-specific, checksum-first instructions above. Cautious users should read
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), read [docs/distribution.md](docs/distribution.md),
and consider building from source.

### Where does state live?

On the machine where Hermes runs.

Sessions, Kanban, cron jobs, files, skills, and usage are read from the
active connection and profile. In direct-local mode those are your current
macOS account's real Hermes files on this Mac. In SSH mode they remain on the
remote host. Hermes Desktop does not maintain a synchronized mirror of Hermes
state.

Some local app preferences and connection details are stored under
`~/Library/Application Support/HermesDesktop`. That includes connection
profiles, pinned sessions, bookmarked files, workflow presets, sidebar order,
and appearance preferences such as terminal font/theme and optional background
image assets. The current local state is documented in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

### When do I need SSH working in Terminal first?

Only for an `SSH Host` connection. Direct-local `This Mac` connections do not
require SSH.

For SSH hosts, the app uses the same SSH path your Mac already uses, but in a
non-interactive way. If Terminal still needs password entry, host key
confirmation, or other interactive setup for that target, the app will usually
hit the same wall.

### What does Sessions Chat do?

It runs the real Hermes TUI through the active local or SSH connection, hosted
inside the `Sessions` view of the app.

Starting a new chat launches `hermes --tui` in an embedded TUI terminal.
Resuming a session launches `hermes --tui --resume <session-id>`, with the
selected Hermes profile preserved when one is active.

The important detail is that Chat is a hosted `hermes --tui` surface, not a
separate Desktop conversation backend. Sessions still reads persisted
transcripts from the active Hermes store, which remains the source of truth.

### Does Hermes Desktop replace a file manager or IDE?

No.

It lets you browse directories on the active Hermes machine and bookmark
selected text files next to the canonical Hermes files. It is still a focused
Hermes workspace, not a full file manager, SFTP client, or IDE. Text files up
to 10 MB are editable.

### What happens if a file changed after I opened it?

Hermes Desktop will not blindly overwrite it.

Before saving an edited workspace file or skill, the app checks whether the
file on the active Hermes machine still matches the version you opened. If it
changed, save is blocked and your unsaved edits stay intact until you reload
intentionally.

## Where Hermes Desktop goes next

Most of the original roadmap is now shipped.

Hermes Desktop has reached the shape it was aiming for: a calm, capable native
macOS workspace for the real Hermes workflow, anchored to the machine where
Hermes runs as the source of truth.

From here, the work is not about adding novelty for its own sake. It is about:

- polishing onboarding, diagnostics, Files ergonomics, terminal UX, and
  multi-connection details
- tracking upstream Hermes Agent changes so the app stays close to the real
  Hermes workflow
- keeping the trust story and release documentation aligned with the code and
  actual distribution model

Anything larger than that should be justified by Hermes itself, not added just
because it is technically possible.
